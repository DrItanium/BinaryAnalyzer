This software is designed to provide an easy way to perform clean room reverse
engineering of binary file formats. It is not capable of figuring things out
for the user. Instead, it is designed to make it easy to figure out the
differences between files after changes have been made using a proprietary
application. 

Also, this analyzer suite requires the CLIPS expert system. CLIPS can be
downloaded at http://clipsrules.sourceforge.net. You are going to need to be
running 6.30 Beta or higher as that's the version I am targeting.
